## Where to get help with rusty-apps projects

---

## General

First off please **do not** create issues for general questions, we do have a [DISCORD CHANNEL](https://discord.gg/k8aejMjKjs) that you can use.

As we are currently a small community and do not have people available to chat all the time however we do try to check at least daily in the week and will respond as promptly as we can. Feel free to join and help. :smile:

In addition to our [DISCORD CHANNEL](https://discord.gg/k8aejMjKjs) some or perhaps all of our repositories will have `discussions` where you may be able find information or ask questions.
If a repository has discussions enabled it there will be a link in it's 'README.md' for instance the slack-message repository has discussions enabled [slack-message README.md](https://github.com/rusty-apps/slack-message) and can be reached at [https://github.com/rusty-apps/slack-message/discussions](https://github.com/rusty-apps/slack-message/discussions)

## Wiki

There is no wiki at present however we endeavor to build up a reasonable set of helpful documents as we progress, again any help greatly appreciated. :smile:

## Contributors

In addition to discord we do have and encourage our contributors to make use of our slack channels.
