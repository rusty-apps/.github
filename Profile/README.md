# Rusty Apps aims to provide 'Blazingly Fast' apps, actions and utilities written in Rust

## About Us

We are an open and inclusive community of people who welcome the help of others in whatever capacity they can give to aid us in producing apps that will hopefully be of benefit to the wider community: [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All code is open source and provided as is and free of charge to the community through the devotion and generosity of voluntary contributers in giving up their own free time to help.

## Become a contributer

Becoming a contributer is easy, pick up an issue or enhance the documentation, testing or features or engage with useful suggestions, read our [CONTRIBUTING GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
